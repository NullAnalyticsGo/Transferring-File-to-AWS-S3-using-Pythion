# Transferring-File-to-AWS-S3-using-Python
We often come across with the lack of disk space when we are dealing with the large datasets. So now-a-days most of the people are referring the
cloud based technology for storing of data instead of using disk space which can be quite insufficient... 
To access the AWS-S3, one should have a credientials of it.
You can directly access the AWS S3 by login into https://aws.amazon.com/ and access the S3.
But instead of directly saving into S3 there is also one more method is by using Python tools to save the file into csv if you have access to the AWS S3.
I too have attached the python code on how to transfer the file to AWS-S3 using python.
